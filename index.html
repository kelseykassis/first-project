<h1>THINGS I'VE LEARNED THAT WILL HELP ME WITH MY THESIS</h1>
<h3>Background Info: I am a graphic design and studio art student. My thesis is textile and design based--specifically rug making with a tufting gun, and various hand done techniques</h3>
<p>So a really cool thing I learned this week actually has to do with making my machine work more efficiently. A tufting gun is a power tool, and it is used by threading yarn through a small hole at the top of the needle. Much of what makes it efficient is determined by yarn tension. If the yarn tension is too loose, the yarn can't continue to self-feed through the gun, and subsequently, unthreads every five seconds. Which is very frustrating. But I have found a solution to this issue. The solution is threading two strands of yarn instead of one. By doing this, it fills the gap in the 'needle' and tightens the tension. By doing this, not only will it self feed without unthreading, but it also creates a much tighter stitch, which makes a higher quality rug as a result. </p>

<h3>These new changes to my work flow are instrumental to my thesis' success, especially since it helps me remain cost efficient with my supplies, and ensures a higher quality that will last well beyond my actual presentation. </h3>
